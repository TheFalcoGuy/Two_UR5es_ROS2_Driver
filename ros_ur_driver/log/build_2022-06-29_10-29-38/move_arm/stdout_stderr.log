CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmoveit_visual_tools.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "moveit_visual_tools", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "moveit_visual_tools" with any of the following names:

    moveit_visual_toolsConfig.cmake
    moveit_visual_tools-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "moveit_visual_tools" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "moveit_visual_tools_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "moveit_visual_tools" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
