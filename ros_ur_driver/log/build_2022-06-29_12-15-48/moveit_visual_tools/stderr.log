CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmoveit_planning_scene_monitor.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "moveit_planning_scene_monitor", but CMake
  did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "moveit_planning_scene_monitor" with any of the following names:

    moveit_planning_scene_monitorConfig.cmake
    moveit_planning_scene_monitor-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "moveit_planning_scene_monitor" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "moveit_planning_scene_monitor_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "moveit_planning_scene_monitor"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
