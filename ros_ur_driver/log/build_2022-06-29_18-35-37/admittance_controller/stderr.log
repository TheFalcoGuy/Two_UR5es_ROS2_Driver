CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findfilters.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "filters", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "filters" with any
  of the following names:

    filtersConfig.cmake
    filters-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "filters" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "filters_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "filters" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
